Approach followed :-
TextBlob - This library iterates through a list of cleaned reviews, calculates the sentiment polarity for each review using TextBlob, and appends the polarity scores. Further sentiment is assigned based on polarity score. 
GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings are loaded from a file named 'glove.6B.100d.txt'. It iterates through each line of the file, splits the line to separate the word and its corresponding vector representation, converts the vector representation into a NumPy array of type float32, and stores each word along with its embedding vector in the 'embeddings_index' dictionary.
A function is created that computes the document embedding by averaging the GloVe embeddings of tokens present in the document, excluding tokens not found in the embeddings index. If the document has no valid tokens, it returns a zero vector.
